# Providers are the main components that are fetching data. They handle all
# state storage and requests to data sources. There are currently five types of
# providers:
#
# - rpc
# - heimdall
# - sensor_network
# - system
# - hash_divergence
#
# Providers usually will have `name`, `label`, and `interval` field.
#
# The name field corresponds to the name of the network you're trying to
# observe. These are the currently known networks. See ./network/network.go for
# details.
#
# - "Puppynet"
#	- "Heimdall Puppynet"
# - "Shibarium"
# - "Heimdall Shibarium"
# - "Ethereum"
# - "Sepolia"
#
# If you wish to have a custom network name, you should define those in the
# network section in this file.
#
# The label field helps differentiate providers that share the same network. For
# example, two RPC providers may observe Ethereum, but from different RPC
# endpoints. Here, it would be helpful to use the RPC url as the label to help
# differentiate them.
#
# The interval field is used to override the runner.interval default.
providers:
  # The system provider captures data for the panoptichain level system metrics.
  # Metrics such as panoptichain uptime are captured by this provider. See
  # ./observer/system.go and ./provider/system.go for details.
  system:
    interval: 30

  # RPC providers will fetch data from an Ethereum based RPC server. See
  # ./provider/rpc.go and ./observer/rpc.go for implementation details.
  #
  # RPC providers also have certain contracts they can observe. The contract
  # specific metrics they can observe are:
  #
  # - state_sync_receiver_address   (PoS)
  # - state_sync_sender_address     (PoS)
  # - checkpoint_address            (PoS)
  #
  #
  # Some of these contracts are versioned contracts, which means they take in a
  # version along with the contract address. This is because there are slight
  # differences in the ABIs among versions.
  #
  # RPC providers also have the ability to specify configuration for the time to
  # mine metric. It will periodically send transactions to the network and
  # record how long they took to be included in a block. Here's an example RPC
  # provider tailored for the time to mine metric.
  #
  #
  #   For your label, prepending it with something like `ttm` or `time to mine`
  #   will help you differentiate the metrics among the other providers with the
  #   same network.
  #
  #   label: "time-to-mine.zkevm-rpc.com"
  #
  #   Generally, you would use a higher interval than normal to prevent the
  #   wallet funds from being drained too quickly.
  #
  #   interval: 150
  #
  #   time_to_mine:
  #     sender: ""
  #     sender_private_key: ""
  #     receiver: ""
  #     value: 10000000000000 # 0.00001 ether
  #     gas_limit: 21000
  #
  #   The gas price factor specifies how much to multiply the gas price by.
  #   This value will default to 1 if not set.
  #
  #     gas_price_factor: 3
  #
  #   Data is optional field where you can provide the transaction ABI-encoded
  #   data if you wish.
  #
  #     data: ""
  #
  # RPC providers can query the balance of certain accounts. You can specify
  # these accounts like so:
  #
  # accounts:
  #   - "0x123"
  #   - "0x..."
